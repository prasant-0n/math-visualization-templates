# 🧮 Math Problem Visualization Using Frontend Templates

**By Prasanta Kumar Sahoo — Backend Development Intern**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to translate **mathematical problem-solving** into **interactive, visually structured front-end templates**.  

It was developed as part of an academic assignment to apply **Trigonometry** and **Compound Interest** concepts using **predefined UI templates**, focusing on **logical flow, accuracy, and visual clarity** without altering the original design.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To dynamically represent mathematical calculations through fixed template layouts while maintaining:

- Consistent visual hierarchy  
- Step-by-step logical progression  
- Accurate arithmetic and formula representation  
- Strict adherence to provided front-end design constraints  

---

## 🧩 Project Structure

| Template | Concept | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Template 1** | Trigonometry / Pythagorean Triplets | Solves trigonometric ratio problems using step-by-step arithmetic logic with visual guidance. |
| **Template 2** | Compound Interest | Visualizes compound interest growth using percentage and exponential calculations in a structured layout. |

Each template includes **stylized boxes, arrows, and highlights** to guide the logical flow of the solution.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Built using **static HTML & CSS templates**  
- Only numbers, variables, and calculation steps were modified — **layout unchanged**  
- Visual logic preserved with **highlight boxes, arrows, and fraction placeholders**  
- Screenshots included for all rendered outputs  
- Demonstrates clean **step-by-step problem-solving** in a UI format  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Implemented

- **Template 1 (Trigonometry):** Pythagorean triplet-based calculations  
  - Example: \( a=8, b=15, c=17 \), Sec C + Cot A calculation  
- **Template 2 (Compound Interest):** Compound interest problems  
  - Example: Principal ₹12,000 → Amount ₹20,736 in 3 years at 20% interest  

---

## 🧾 Deliverables

1. **Template 1:** 2 Trigonometry problems  
2. **Template 2:** 2 Compound Interest problems  
3. Screenshots of all rendered outputs  
4. README documentation for clarity and presentation
